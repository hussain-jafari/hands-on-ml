# Hands on Machine Learning 

This repository contains notebooks I made as I was going through [Hands on Machine Learning by Aurélien Géron](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920052289.do), to use as references/notes.

The author's repository for this book can be found [here](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml).
